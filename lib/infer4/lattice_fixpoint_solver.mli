(* A fixpoint-oriented solver for (in)equalities over multivariate lattice
   polynomials with an explicit separation between rigid variables and solver
   variables.

   Key ideas (from NOTES.md):
   - Only solve solver variables (each exactly once via LFP or GFP).
   - Rigid variables are named external symbols; they are never solved.
   - Force before use: substitute solved solver vars; treat unsolved solver vars
     as their paired rigid variable; public normalization returns a list of
     (lat * V.t list) with only rigid variable names.
   - LFPs are solved before any GFP (attempting GFP first should be rejected).

  (* Anonymous solver variables, each solved exactly once (lfp/gfp). *)

  (* Polynomial type over the lattice [lat], built from rigid variable names
     (V.t) and solver variables. *)
  type poly

  (* Create a fresh solver variable. *)
  val new_var : unit -> var

  (* Inject variables/constants into polynomials. [rigid] inserts a named rigid
     variable; [var] inserts a solver variable. *)

  val rigid : V.t -> poly

  (* Lattice structure on polynomials *)

  val join : poly -> poly -> poly

  (* Solve a least- or greatest-fixpoint equation for a solver variable. After
     solving, occurrences of the variable are substituted by its solution by an
     internal forcing pass and will be eliminated in [normalize]. *)

  (* Enter query phase: solves any pending GFPs and prevents further LFP/GFP. *)

  (* Pure check and normalization under the current solutions. [leq a b] holds
     iff force(a) â‰¤ force(b). *)
  val leq : poly -> poly -> bool

  (* Normalize to a list of terms (coeff, vars), where [vars] are rigid names
     (sorted) and all solver variables have been eliminated via forcing. *)
  val normalize : poly -> (lat * V.t list) list

  (* Decompose/group by designated rigid variables' names in [universe]. Works
     on the forced form. *)
  val decompose_by : universe:V.t list -> poly -> (V.t list * poly) list

  (* Linear decomposition specialized from [decompose_by]. Works on the forced
     form. *)

     set, logs print rigid vars as "_" and coefficients as "âŠ¤". *)
